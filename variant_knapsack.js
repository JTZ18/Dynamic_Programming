/**
 * Given a knapsack of maximum capacity m, we want to pack inside it items selected from n
possible items. Item i (for 1 ≤ i ≤ n) has size si ≥ 0 and value vi ≥ 0. Each item i could be
selected up to ti (ti > 0) times, but the total number of items (counting repeats) selected must
not exceed ttotal, where ttotal is some value satisfying 0 < ttotal ≤
Pn
i=1 ti
. Your goal is to select
at most ttotal items, with total size at most m, such that the total value of the selected items is
maximized. What is the maximum possible total value of the selected items?

// Design an algorithm to solve the problem with dynamic programming.
